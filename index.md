##Chapter One##

The arrows, hurtled from the dark recesses of the trees, fell around them, skidding stupidly along the ice. Manan, running at full tilt, felt giddy and powerful and terrified all at the same time. The other girl, whose hand she gripped tightly, seemed less buoyed by the hail of flint, wood, and arrows. Manan gave her a rough tug just before an arrow landed right at their heels. It bounced, tipped, and veered away. We may just make it, she thought, seeing the ice lake's shore just ahead.

Whoever let the next arrow fly, however, had a truer aim. The arrow didn't find it's mark, but it grazed the other girl's calf, shredding the folds of rough spun blankets, leaving a trail of blood behind. Fortunately for Manan, the girl was so insensible that the wound didn't seem to phase her. The girl just groaned and continued being pulled along the ice.

Manon tried not to look back, tried to keep her eyes trained on the shore line that grew nearer and nearer. She could start to see shapes of the trees emerge from the dark rough mass that stood there previously. With her senses fired up the way they though, everything stood out sharply, including the streaks of fire in the dark sky. The dry, brittle brush along the lake caught fire and began to light up the night. 

The flaming arrows became more constant now but there was more lake to cross. Manon decided to peer back over her shoulder, just to be sure no one was on their trail. The ice was thick, she knew, but a whole pack of men pounding over it probably would break it, at least that was her hope. As she turned her head, though, her foot caught in the girl's loose, tattered coverings and they spilled forward, sliding several feet across the ice.

They spun out and around, facing each other on their stomachs. Their eyes met then became obscured by the puffs of their breath in the cold. "Are you okay?" Manan asked the girl.

"I...I think so..." the girl replied, shivering out the words. 

Crouching on that flat sheet of ice wouldn't save them, but they rested until they heard dogs barking and whimpering. The whimpering gave way to the sound of paws and nails fervently scratching at the ice to reach them. It was time to move again, but both girls seemed frozen in place.

As they lay there, though, Manan could see steam rising up from around the girl. She's melting the ice around her, she realized. The ice probably wouldn't crack, but it wouldn't hold forever. Manan didn't intend to slip through a hole in the ice, and she certainly didn't care to be mauled by dogs.

She sat the girl up, careful not to touch her exposed hands and arms. The dogs were gaining on them, maybe would overtake them no matter what. Fortunately, the air increasingly was tinged with the smell of burning brush and pitch. Though she hated to waste supplies, the sizzling, melting ice and the girl who melted it gave her an idea. She reached for a bottle filled with dark powder from her coat and put in in the girls hands, "Hold this for for me," she told the girl.

She dropped the bottle carefully. Instantly, the bottle began to lose its shape, Manan yanked it back and tossed it across the ice, towards the dogs. The bottle crashed and popped loudly on the ice. A bright wall of flames reach up and arced forward. Behind the glare and glow, Manon could only hear the dogs whimpering and retreating.

The pyrotechnics seemed to stanch the flood of arrows too. Without the constant twang and scrape around them, the night suddenly seemed very quiet. Manan picked up the girl and heaved her forward. Soon enough their huffing breath kept the quiet at bay.

***

Running on ice wasn't easy, but crashing through the dead undergrowth of the forest with a limp loose girl wasn't any better. The girl kept stumbling and falling. When she tried to pick herself up, the branches would singe and the rocks go black. This won't do, Manan though, realizing that they were leaving an obvious trail behind them. 

They had lost the element of surprise entirely, though, so darting off into the night wasn't really much of an option anyway. Manan had underestimated how much sleeping powder it would take to make the large potbellied man who watched over the girl at night stay asleep. The cruel thing wasn't that he awoke, rather that his half-asleep tossings and moanings woke the boy who was his attendant, a word which the townspeopel used in place of the word "slave."

The boy, who normally had tried to keep as much covering to himself as possible, woke quickly when all of the furs and blankets were yanked from him. He must have been cold blooded like a reptile, Manan though, given how tolerant of the heat he was. As her own face dripped in sweat, the boy took to shivering then shouting when he saw her lifting the girl from her resting place.

Quick as she was with her throwing knives, the only weapon she had learned to use with any confidence, she couldn't plunge one in the boy's stomach fast enough to keep him from waking up he town. She managed to escape with the girl, but only before rousing every hunter in the town armed with a long bow and a bountiful quiver of arrows.

Even had she and the girl been able to slip through the forest unheard and unseen, they probably could not evade the townspeople's will to find them forever. That will exposed to Manan the fundamental flaw in her plan. It was too late now to undecided her course of action. She had chosen to steal away this girl, this girl who burned everything the touched, and kept the town by the icy lake warm during its endless winters.

Their crashing and scurrying came to sudden halt at a sword's point. "Did you think you could steal away our precious child?" the man known as Cotton asked her. He was an old man, something like a town elder, but really an outsider employed by the town to protect the girl who became to slump into Manan's arms. "Did you think that I, her protector, would let a little trickster magician like you run out and get away? Foolish child."

During her short time in the town, Manan had not interacted much with the man called Cotton. Had this been the vain town council man, or a silly girl dazzled by her magic show, then a slight of hand or some clever words might have sufficed to lower the blade. But this man before them seemed implacable. 

"By my oath, I should kill you now for violating the sacred rights of ownership that the good people of that town assert over this child."

"But she isn't even their natural born child, you know that!"

"She became so when the town took her in and cared for her..."

"And imprisoned her and exploited her..."

"As opposed to, what, child? This girl, your captive, my ward, is a freak of nature, a cast off and rejected. You cannot amend what Nature has set forth. And now, I must make right what you have determined to make wrong."

The girl began to whimper and shake in distress as the man named Cotton drew back his sword. Yet instead of hearing the whoosh of his sword, Manan only heard an oompf and thud as he hit the ground. Looking up, an enormous woman filled the space where he had once been. She carried a cudgel made from a knotted branch and was wrapped head to foot in furs.

"He always was to talkative for my taste," the woman said. "Didn't even hear me coming, did you, old boy?" She grinned and laughed. "Come on girl, get the other one up, we've got to get back to the road."

Without comment, Manan picked up the girl and tried to work through the rest of the woods as best as they could. Fortunately, this large giant of a woman had beaten back the forest in her wake. 

When they stepped out of the woods onto the narrow road, Manan saw the woman's cart and shaggy oxen harnassed to it. "Get it and we'll be away from here soon enough. Be careful with the girl. I don't need by livelihood going up in flames," she said.

***

The shaggy beast pulling the cart wasn't a horse and couldn't be whipped up to a brisk trot. All that Manan could do was fret in the back hidden under loose planks on the floor. With a heavy cloth thrown over everything, the space was cramped and hot. It didn't help being so close to the girl, either. 

The woman had helped Manan wrap the girl back up carefully before easing her into the shallow channel. The woman had shrugged at the cut on the girl's leg. The blood was already drying and crusting in place. "At least she's no bleeder," the woman said. They shoved her him, then Manan wiggled in next to her, hoping that the cart wouldn't go up in flames.

Though she was young, she had had a brief career already in the various dark arts of sneaking, smuggling, and trickery. She had spent several months with a group of smugglers who were equipped with carts very similar to this one. Would others recognize the creaking, deep bottomed wagon for what it was? Or would they pass over as this...merchant made her way down from the mountains.

Knowing that she couldn't burst forth from her captivity and take the reins, Manan spent her confinement collecting her thoughts. She focused particularly on this women and tried to separate out all of the pieces that might explain why she was helping them. And how had she found them in the woods. Of course, another thing Manan had learned in her brief career was to no prod too far into the circumstances surrounding good fortune. Making luck could be a very dirty business sometimes.

She had seen the woman a few times in the town in the days leading up to this...caper. "The Water Woman," the townspeople called her, and probably many more like them. Of course, Manan knew that she was one of just many water women, and a smattering of men too. But this one was unique for her size and strength, no doubt gained by hauling and lugging huge containers of water here and there.

Even under the planks and canvas covering, she could here the water sloshing back and forth in their heavy pots. As they traveled on, the water made Manan feel as though they were stow aways on a ship crossing rough seas. At least there in the open water your destination was shore. Here on land, shoved in this woman's wagon, the destination was unknown, Manan's course uncharted.

##Chapter Two##

"The sun?" was the first questioned she asked in the glare of daylight. The light had leapt into the channel at the bottom of wagon suddenly, aggressively when the woman pulled back the covering and fake boards. 

"Yes, it's daytime now. Has been for a while," the woman replied. She reached down to help Manan up and out. "You can stretch your legs if you'd like, but make it quick." As Manan looked back at the girl, the woman added, "Don't worry about her, she's got a few more hours of sleep stored up in her."

It was true, the poor girl probably hadn't slept, really slept in months, if not years. Not that Manan, with her usuall hand to mouth existence, could claim much better, but begin haggard and grumpy could not compare to what this girl had gone through. Or, so she supposed.

She jumped down from the wagon and her stiff legs caught her and boyoued her up. They loosened quickly enough as she paced aroudn the wagon. Now in the daylight, she could feel the cold mountain air seeping through her clothes. Last night had been excitement and momentum. No time for cold when you were capering. 

"Dont' wander off," the woman warned her. "And be careful about your tracks." 

The road here, really the ruts that made up the road now, was really just layers and layers of compacted snow. If it hadn't been for the surefooted oxedn and the studded wagon wheels, they would not have made it far at all. Manan's feet even slipped out from under her several times. She caught her balance quicky, As I always do, she though, but the inner bravado was all acting, really. On the compacted road, her route around the wagon would leeave little to no trail, certainly nothing that the town hunters could pick up. They were skilled at tracking antlered beasts, but not tracking men for leagues and leagues.

As she paced, Manan struggled to reorganized the thoughts she had managed to line up and make tidy the night before. With her legs stuff and belly tinged with hunger, it was harder to keep those ordered facts in place. They had a tendency to wander and reshuffle just as she wanted to turn over some bit in her mind.

One particular bit was the woman's name. She though that she had heard someone address the Water Woman in the town, but the name would not surface in her mind. Strangely, given that she was human contraband on this woman's wagon, Manan felt relucatant to ask. Playing the game truly and well meant arming yourself with information before asserting some position. Not know much about this woman made Manan feel weak, and she hated feeling weak.

Wrapped up as tight in these inner convolutions as she was in her rough spun cloak and coverings, she didn't hear to woman calling her over to sit. When she did hear, she came over to the back of the wagon. The woman sat there with a handful of something. She offered them to Manan and said, "Chew these for your hunger. I don't have much else right now."

The wrinkled hard seeds became tacky and chewy as Manan tried to eat them. Deciding that she couldn't chew them, she settled on sucking on a handful of them in the back of her check. Whatever they were, she felt revitalized very quickly, ready to continue their...journey.

***

As the wagon rocked and bounced over those hard ice roads, Manan swayed in and out of sleep. Several hours after the break, the wagon lurched to a stop. Manan's eyes opened wide at the sound of a man's voices. The girl was still asleep. Hopefully she would stay that way. Reflexively she felt her hand drift ot he knife at her waist. It would be useless to fight if they discovered her, but her instincts were tuned this way. So, she didn't resist them and palmed the worn wooden hilt. 

She could only just make out what was happening outside, but she heard the woman assert, "You've no claim to search me..." Then an argument ensued. The wagon rocked back and forth. The quarrel was agitating the beast. The woman tried to calm it. Manan twisted slighly to press her ear closer to the wagon's bottom to hear better.

"My people passed untouched. That's a right we have."

"Rights ent meant for smugglers," said a man's voice. If there was only one voice and one man, Manan assumed that the woman would dispatch him as easily as she had Cotton.

But there was another voice, "Words gotten around. The towns and villages have been put on alert...two girls and maybe a Water Woman accomplice. And we look after our own..."

By rights they weren't able to search her wagon, Manan knew. The Water Women could not be seized, jailed, or otherwise molested. It had always been that way. But that didn't stop a heavy pair of boots from stomping overhead in the wagon. A man, smelling of smoke and ale, began rifling through the wagon. With the coverings over the floor, Manan couldn't see where he was, but could hear each creak on the floor boards and feel them press closer to her face under the man's weight.

The man shouted out, "Nothing in her but the dame's old pots..." His voice was loud and harsh after all of the muffled rattling and shuffling. The sound woke the girl up, her eyes perfectly round and bright all of a sudden. She was bound very tightly in her covering but tried to thrash regardless. Before she could cry out, Manan gripped her mouth tightly.

The bright big eyes just stared back at her stupidly, only animated by animal fear. Manan could hear the man muttering, "Queer cart...what's that sound...awful hot in here..." Then a pot shattered on the ground. And another. Another one again.

The wagon bounced. The woman had jumped down. The men raised their cries. Manan could hear a bow being drawn and quarterstaffs knocking violently against each other. A man cried out in pain. Another one cursed the woman's sex and invoked the gods too. Manan heard the bow release and thud into something, a tree? A woman? She couldn't tell.

But a crackle of bone and a squish of flesh followed the thud. Another pot crashed loudly to the ground before the cart was rid of the intruder and his boots. A loud oopmh then a plea for mercy. "You defiled me and my trade. You broke the ancient pacts. By law I can and will kill you." the woman said. And then the intruder and his boots died a loud but quick death.

With that, Manan was staring up at the woman's face. She had a large red welt on the side of her face. It wasn't until Manan sat up that she saw an arrow poking out from the woman's side and blood flowing freely over her clothing, coloring the wagon's covering red. "You're hurt," she said.

"Yes, but I will survive. You'll help me. I need you to drive the cart."

"But where are we going."

"Some place safe and not far, but I will be too weak to drive soon. The beast knows the way. I have whispered it to him, but we can't have a riderless wagon along these roads, especially at night and especially where we're going. Go up front a drive. Now."

Manan usually didn't take commands well, but she listened to the woman's strained order. She jumped out of the wagon and ran to front. Around her, six men lay dead; seven counting the one who had searched the wagon. Good riddance, she thought, though not exactly sure why. Had these been bad men? Perhaps, but they had crossed lines that weren't meant to be crossed. Lines that were recognized and acknowledged and held firmly in place. 

Whether she too had crossed such lines didn't occur to her as she took up the stiff reins. The beast lurched forth now that it senesed a driver in place. Manan didn't know how to drive an animal, but the woman was right. The beast seemed to know where it was going.

***

They veered off the road suddenly. The beast seemed to be following some barely visible path through the woods. Manan couldn't make out the path herself and her hands slacked off on the reins. She had held them tightly, even though she had done nothing useful with them for the last few hours. 

There didn't seem to be tracks for the wagon to follow, which meant that this path was rarely used. This also meant that the track was not well worn. The wagon jostled from side the side, much more roughly than before. The sudden increase of groans from the back meant that the woman could feel it as well.

The beast led them along for at least another hour before it stopped suddenly. The woman called out to her, "Girl, girl, come here." Manan jumped down from the front of the wagon and pulled back the covering. Inside, the woman was pale and breathing rapidly. She held her side, though the red had bled through all of the rags she held there. The woman lifted her head up at the sight of Manan and said, "There is a cave mouth hidden nearby. It's hidden by trees and branches. Clear it and the beast will enter."

To their left rocks jutted out and climbed up from the slope of the mountain side. Manan scanned the area for several minutes before she could make out a spot where a cave opening could be. As she approached the spot, she she began to see how someone had carefully arranged the undergrowth and foilage to hide the cave. Clearing the opening wasn't easy and required a hatchet that she found strapped by the wagon's driver's seat.

When the opening was clear, the beast lurched forward and guided the wagon inside. They travelled down a cooridor before entering in a large chamber. The light was dim here. The woman showed her how to light the wagon's lantern. Soon enough, she had lit up the cave the other lanterns affixed into the cave walls around them.

The chamber walls were rough, but still too even and regular. Someone, long ago had crafted this spot, probably anticipating situations exactly like this one. Perhaps not the exact circumstances, but the Water Women prepared for trouble on the long roads they travelled.

Now that they had light, Manan helped the woman out of the wagon. She laid her down on the smooth cold cave floor. The woman opened her eyes, "Have you ever removed an arrow before?" Manan shook her head. "Do you have a knife?" 

"I do, it's here..." Manan unsheathed the knife at her waist. It was crude and not well made, more than a beggar's shank but not a warrior's blade. 

"Well, it looks sharp enough. You must open the wound and remove the arrow head." Manan went to do just that. The woman grabbed her arm with surprising speed and stregth, "Carefully." 

Manan set to cutting at the spot where the arrow pierced the woman's side. Blood seeped out and ran across the woman's skin. With a little wiggling, Manan pulled the arrow out. "Now, I have herbs in the wagon, and water..." This Manan knew. She crawled up and found the girl sitting up holding her head in her hands.

"Are you okay?" Manan asked.

"I...I don't know...Where are we?"

"In a cave. Let me, let me get something. You stay here. I'll be back." She returned to the woman and cleansed the wound, packed it with herbs, then dressed it as best as she could in the flickering cave light.

"The girl is awake. I should see her."

"Yes," the woman agreed. "I will rest here for now."

***

"It's dark in here..." the girl said as Manan approached.

"Yes, we're in a cave," she explained again. She tried to smooth and round off the anxiousness in her voice. The last few hours had been overwhelming and strange. "And you are okay?"

"I don't know. Where are we?" The girl looked around.

"Come with me, let's get out of this wagon." Manan reached out for her and girl flinched away. "It's okay. I won't hurt you."

"But I might hurt you."

"Yes, you might." Manan tried to grab her arm as best she could through the thick wrappings and helped her down into the cave.

They walked around and stood by the beast, who was still harnessed to the wagon. It looked over at Manan and snorted. She didn't know the first thing about tending to animals like these. Would it be hungry? Grow restless in the dark cave? She would have to wait and see.

But the beast's intelligent look did draw her to it. She began running her hands through its thick pelt, along the corded, tight muscles of his neck and haunches. The girl was staring at the woman who had passed out; her head had rolled to the side. "Who's that?" the girl asked. 

"A friend. She helped us escape. That's her beast and her wagon." 

"He's a nice beast," the girl said.

"Yes, he seems very nice."

"Can I touch him?"

"I don't know. You can try..."

But when the girl got close to the beast it flinched and began stepping side to side, too well trained to bolt and clearly struggling through the impulse to do so. The girl pulled away and sat sullenly on the cave floor.

"It's okay. We're strangers. He doesn's know us."

"No, he doesn't. But you don't know me. You don't pull away..."

"No, I don't. But you don't know me either."

"I don't. But you seem...nice." The word seemed hard for her to say. Surely she hadn't said it very often.

"Come on. Let's try to eat something." She only had the dried up berries in her pocket that the woman gave her. She handed a few to the girl who shoved them in her mouth without questioning what they were and might taste like. Manan also chewed the last few berries, hoping that the Water Women had provisioned this cave somehow.

"I'm thirsty," the girl said after they chewed over the berries in silence. "Water?"

The wagon was filled with water; it existed for the sake of water. But taking water from a Water Woman's cart was forbidden and could lead to death. The men on the road had learned that lessen. The Water Women were unbending about this rule. But surely these two girls were an exception. Was there a provision for those taken under a Woman's care and protection?

The girl shifted uneasily and pulled at her throat. She's like a child, Manan thought. A very sad child. Manan had encountered beggar children before who had such an unreal look of sadness about them. She had seen areas ravaged by a battle, by a plague, by follies real and unreal. Often children were left behind to suffer and be sad. Be sad then perish or survive.

Manan knew about survival. Here she was after all. And this girl who she had taken under her protection needed water and would have water as a result. She crawled back into the wagon and found a large cup hanging from a hook. Cup in hand, she knelt down before on the large vessels of water and tapped it, filling the cup to the top. 

The water in that vessel was precious; some claimed it had magical properties. People held it in such esteem that they would fight battles to claim it. The Water Women delivered it everywhere that people demanded it. Manan had only tasted it once or twice and though nothing of it. Now, the water did seem to have magical glow to it in the dim cave light. It seemed to smell of herbs, only Manan, who knew much about herbs and potions, could place the smell or the taste.

She carefully brought the cup back to the girl and held it for her as she drank. The water ran down from the corners of the girl's mouth, turning to steam as soon as it contacted her burning skin. Manan took the cup over to the woman and propper her head up. She let drops of the water trickle into the woman's mouth. 

Then she tasted it herself. The water felt like a light streaming through her body. She felt...cleaner inside somehow. The air around her seemed crisper and fragrant. She wanted to drink more and more or it, but the cup was empty. But she help the cup up again anyway, hoping that some hidden drop would roll from the dented metal into her mouth.

But the cup was dry. She could get more. She hadn't taken that much from the jar. The woman wouldn't miss it, would she. How would she know? Images of the dead men flahsed into her consciousness, as if some part of her was trying to pull back from this greed. But those had been bad men, terrible men who would have done terrible things to them. Manan wasn't a terrible man like that. Only a few more drops might help.

Before she could fill the cup again, though, the woman stirred then sat up. She looked at the cup in Manan's hand then at Manan herself. Manan suddenly felt guiltly and wrong, maybe she was like those bad men after all. She desperately searched the woman's face for some new shape of her mouth, or motion in her eyes, to read what was passing in her mind. Unlocking such thoughts was another skill that she had acquired in her relatively short life.

She couldn't read the woman's thoughts at all, but the tension in the woman's face released and she said, "You were thirsty."

"She was thirsty."

"And you drank too."

"Yes."

"You are under my protection, for now. What is mine is yours. That is our way."

##Chapter 3##

After three days in the cave, the woman was able to stand and move around with help from Manan. She taught Manan how to care for the beast, who they let forage in the woods around the cave and generally fend for itself. "The wild comes back when it needs to," the woman explained. At night the beast came back to the cave, often speckeld white from the snow fall. It shook itself then took station near them and the fire. 

The wagon provided a seemingly endless supply of resources and provision. The woman had stocked it well, as if she had anticipated their adventure. But Manan reminded herself of how far and wide this woman probably trecked before returning to wherever the Water Women went. No one knew for sure where they came from and where they drew their water. Maybe it was one place; maybe it was many places. Manan didn't dare ask, at this point.

They also found more provisions in the cave. Someone had hidden food and medical supplies and a small store of weapons as well. "Take only what we need for now," the woman instructed. What they *needed* obviously included a short sword that the woman brandished and a spear that she handed to Manan. "Good against riders and strong men," she explained.

The woman taught her how to handle the spear, mostly treating it like a quarterstaff, but also how to thrust and jab with it. "Only prick the man when you have to. You might not be able to get your weapon back."

Over the course of those days, Manan learned how to hold the spear and began to embellish her movements. The girl seemed to enjoy her exaggerated, dance-like routines. "You are a good magician and acrobat," the woman said, only half-smiling.

The girl seemed more comfortable with them both now, but would not let them get too near. In the confines of the cave with her burning skin, the girl was smelling badly. Deciding to set a good example, Manan had pulled a large empty tub into the middle of the cave. "Don't use the water. Snow..." the woman said. 

With a bucket, Manan filled the tub with snow. It began to melt on its own, but still clumped and clung to itself. Manan was not one to be filled with shame and stripped down in front of the girl and the woman. She tried to step into the tub, but flinched and cried out at the cold. "I can help," the girl said, stepping over to the tub.

She seemed embarrassed by Manan's nakedness and didn't look at her directly. But she pulled back the coverings around her arms and stuck them deeply into the snow filled tub. The snow began to melt then steam. "There, that will be nice now."

The relaxation that Manan felt in the hot simmering water must have affected the girl too. Huddled in her mass of coverings, she started to hum some broken tunes together and rocked back and forth. She almost seemed happy and unware of her situation. Manan leaned against the edge of the tub, just watching and listening to her. When the girl noticed, she bowed her head and withdrew. "I liked your singing," she said, trying to coax the girl back out, but she said nothing.

***

After two more days in the cave, Manan was growing restless. She wasn't used to staying put for very long. Her feet and wits had taken her far and wide. She wasn't made to curl up in a cave somewhere and just sit. Not like the girl, who must not have taken more than ten steps their entire time together. Manan continually tried to get teh girl to walk with her, to peer out from the cave entrance, to talk to and brush the beast. 

The girl would have none of it. She shook her head, or would pitch back. She acted like a child might, even though she must have been at least as old as Manan. When the girl slept, the woman pulled Manan aside, "You musn't push too hard."

"I just want her to feel better. She seems so...closed off right now."

"Give the child time. She really is nothing more than a child, after all."

They were both watching the girl. Manan decided to venture a question, a bold question that she had avoided asking thus far, "What do you know about her?"

The woman looked down at her and folded her arms across her broad chest, "Very little. One winter she wasn't there. Then one winter she was."

"And no one said anything about her--who she was; where she came from?"

"No, they said nothing. They did not undersatnd the child, that was clear, only understood what she could do. She kept them warm during the long winters. As long as she did that, they cared about little else."

"It's so cruel..." Manan began, but the woman cut her off.

"Perhaps so, but sometimes we don't see how a kindness becomes cruelty or a cruelty can become a kindness."

"I don't understand."

"Only understand that the girl is still alive. She has that, which is more than I could say had she been found in other places in this world."

"She was a slave..."

"In spirit yes, but where were the chains and lash marks? Where were the brandings and burnings and cuts and slices? I do not defend; I do not judge. You must see the whole thing sometimes before you can truly understand who a person is and how to help them."

Later that night Manan thought about what the woman said as she practiced with her spear. Her prideful, fierce nature rebelled at the condenscening words from this woman who had not even volunteered a name so far. But her more cautious side, the side that kept her alive and saw her through many questionable situations, recognized the debt she owed to the woman. Manan also recognized something of the truth in what the woman said. The straight line that she had drawn in her mind between removing the girl from the town and rescuring her from her fate had veered and grown faint. Not altogether hard to see, but just less straight and bold than she had expected.

She intended to help the girl, didn't she? But her notion of held only extended as far as the rescue, the escape, the harrowing flight in the dark and over the ice. The image had lingered in her mind in the days before she decided to act. It still was a potent image. She would relive that scene in her mind for many years to come; she had no doubt of that. 

But where in this world was a safe haven? Manan found it in her craft--her tricks and skills and ability to think quickly. That shifting quickness made her safe. This girl wasn't so fleet and nimble, though. Could they really just dart from place to place? It seemed unlikely now to Manan. So where was some cottage or house sitting on some piece of land somewhere that she could take this girl and keep her safe?

Maybe this Water Woman could help, even though the help she had volunteered up to now was only immediate and focused on the short term. There had been no grand invitations to take up life as a Water Woman and travel with her through the land. Would Manan even want that? Who could say? In the dim dark of that cave, her wants and needs seemed much less clear. So she gripped the spear harder and parried an endless succession of attacks, then spun to counter attack again and again. Sparing with the air, she always found her mark and dispatched her attackers.

***

<a id="update"></a>Manan's endless sparing had made her tired and she was bored of arranging and rearranding the Water Woman's cart. The beast's pelt was impeccably clean too. Manan had even used one of the woman's tools to file down her long and dirty fingernails. She felt listless and lacking energy and decided to take a nap.

An unexpected sound woke her--the sound of laughter. Leaning up from her pallet of blankets, she saw the girl bent over. It seemed that she was in pain, but then the girl reard back, clutching her side and laughing. The woman was telling her a story. She was that Manan was awake. They had a started a small fire which filled the cave with a pleasant crackling sound. "Come over. I'm about to tell another story." Manan slid out of the blankets and sat on the wood stump that served as a seat near the fire. 

The girl was hunched up; her arms wrapped tightly around her legs. She rolled back and forth on her bottom. The fire light caught her eyes. She looks happy, thought Manan. Her earlier doubts about her rescue attempt seemed silly now. Of c


 about three rabbits who tried to cross an old bridge:

"One day three rabbits were foraging in the woods when they came across an old bridge that spanned a river. The river was far below and seemed like a very swift and strong river. The rabbits could smell a most delicious smell coming form the other side. The sweetest verge grew there."

"And they wanted to eat it!" the girl interjected.

"Yes, they did, but first they had to cross the old bridge. The first rabbit was the bold one. It didn't think much of the other rabbits and their study of the bridge. 'If you want to cross, you just cross' said this one. So it loped out on the bridge. The bridge was very old and shaked from side to side. Soon a gust of wind came by and knocked the rabbit off in the river below. It drifted away in the river feeling very foolish that it was all wet."

"It shouldn't have done that!" the girl said.

"Yes, it was rash, wasn't it?" the woman agreed. She seemed to be looking right at Manan though.

"And the second one? Tell us what the second one did!"

"Well, the second rabbit was more cautious than the first, but thought itself very clever. When it saw a hawk flying overhead, it called to it and asked for help crossing the bridge. The hawk landed on a nearby tree and studied the rabbit. 'Yes, I will help you rabbit.' The hawk made the rabbit nervous at first, but it seemed wise and trustworthy enough. It swooped down, grabbed the rabbit, and flew back to its nest."

"That rabbit never made it to the other side..."

"No, it didn't."

"The third rabbit must have been scarred at that point," girl said. "It should turn back and go home."

"No," the Manan replied. "The grass was too delicious and maybe life was much better across the bridge."

"So, what should it do?"

"Let me continue the story and you'll find out," the woman said. "The third rabbit was just as bold and clever as the other too rabbits, but it also was patient. This rabbit remembered that a farm was nearby. It tracked back to the farm, made itself seen by the farmer, who began to chase the rabbit. The rabbit led the farmer to the bridge, who upon seeing it forgot all about the rabbit. He too became captivated by the sweet smells coming from across the river. The farmer disappeared only to return with his hands and a cart of wood and hammers and nails. The men set to repairing the bridge. The third rabbit waiting and watched. And when the bridge was repaired, it crossed it and filled himself on the sweetest herbs and plants you can imagine."

"But it let the men across too," Manan objected. "What if the farmer decided to continue chasing him? That doesn't seem good."

"It got to the other side," the girl said. "It got the reward. You said that was the most important thing."

Manan was suprised that the girl called her out. The woman seemed amused by the conflict, but didn't interject. "None of the rabbits had a very good plan. I don't think I like this story," she said.

"That may be, but that was what happened, for better or worse, in this story."

##Chapter 4##

"Come foraging with me," the woman said to Manan the next day. Manan had felt sullen since the story, but decided to go with that woman anyway. She couldn't explain why she felt resentful towards the woman, and over a simple story. She felt that there was somethign pointed about the story, but she didn't know what it was. Besides, why was the woman trying to instruct her? What was she trying to do?

Snow fell outside the cave piling up quickly, adding to the piles and piles around them. Manan shivered when they exited the cave and chill took over her. She rubbed at her arms trying to quicken the blood in them.

When they had passed some distance from the save entrance, the woman began shaking snow from the brush, looking for nuts, seeds, or whatever else the animals hadn't grabbed on their own. Manan followed her lead, choosing to ignore the fact that they were leaving obvious signs of their presence.

They worked in silence for some time before the woman finally said, "You didn't like the story I told." 

Manan didn't reply at first. She shifted their foraging basket to be better in between them and tossed a few half husked nuts in with their meager findings. "It was just a story about rabbits. It doesn't matter."

"Maybe not... The girl enjoyed it, though."

"Yes."

"I thought maybe you could tell me your story."

Manan brushed her falling hair back from her face. The vapors from their breath in the cold swirled around their faces. The woman's face was flushed red and bright. "I wouldn't know where to start."

"Start anywhere you would like to."

What would she tell this woman, this large water woman who could protect her or destroy her according to her whims? What had she told the countless people she encountered on the road, in the many towns and villages she had passed through. She had been so many things in the...stories she had told. Princess, peasant, warrior, beggar, slave, thief, attending girl, and many more. 

She was going to begin with one of these stories, one of these lives she had made up. But the scene on the frozen lake flashed in her mind. The feeling of the ice beneath her feet. The sound of the arrows whizzing in the air. So, she began, "I couldn't stand that they were keeping the girl captive. I couldn't imagine what it must be like to be confined in that...chamber they built. I couldn't believe that they had thought to tap in her and make her keep them warm."

"You've said as much before..."

"Yes, and I was performing my shows in the town. I had arrived there a month or so before. I had been in the free cities, where it's warm and money flows freely. I don't know why I ventured into the mountains though. They called to me for some reason. I found a merchant who was travelling there with spices and impressed him with my knowledge of herbs and spices and the like. I sold spices for him in several of the villages around the town before he caught me..."

"Stealing?"

Yes, it was stealing, but she had meant to leave that out of the story. "Stealing... And I escaped before he could bring the village guard to take me away. I found my way to the town and found ways to survive. An innkeeper needed a serving girl to scrub the girls. Well, I have been serving girls who scrub before and did it for a warm place to sleep. My show was popular. I told fortunes too for the wealthy ladies."

"You have many talents," the woman said.

"Mmhmm. Then I learned about the girl and couldn't stop thinking about her and how miserable she must be. And I knew somethign had to be done. Getting her out would be easy. The watchingman's boy was sleepy and the watchignman was so greedy, that he gulped down a confection laced with sleepign powder. I was able to wake the girl, stanch the wounds were the pipes led in her body and get her covered before the boy awoke starting screaming."

The woman knew the rest of the story. There was no reason to go on. But she was sitting back on her knees, waiting expectantly for the rest of the story. the real story of what had happened. "I killed him. I threw my best knife at him. I wished it hadn't been my best knife, but it was. I killed him to escape with the girl."

"He may just be wounded..." the woman tried to say, offering persepctive as seemed to be her wont.

"No, I twisted the knife after he fell. I made...made sure that he was dead. But it didn't stop the watch from being roused and the guards and hunters coming after us. She esacped through the town and the only way out was across the lake. Then you found us and here we are."

"Yes, here we are."

Now that she had told her story, Manan desperately wanted the woman to tell her a story, a story about a young girl who rescued another poor helpless girl from her confinement. A story about a woman so inspired by the girl that we was overhwlemed by the need to help them escape from the evil captors. Manan didn't get to hear that story though. A loud crack sounded in the woods. Birds fled in to the sky. The heard a scurry of creatures rush past them. 

The woman stood up, brushing snow off her shoulders. She seemed even larger than before. "Someone has found us."

***

Manan found herself crouched alone in the snow. The woman had tipped over the foraging basket. Their brown shriveled black findings scattered randomly over the now. She wasn't sure whether or not she should run or chase after the woman and join the fray.

But the fray came to her. The woman was backing slowly, parrying the slow swooping strikes from a sword. The girl's protector--the man named Cotton-- weilded the sword. He seemed singularly determined to bring the mountainous woman to her knees. With every strike, every swipe he made, the woman repelled him.

For a moment, it seemed like the advantage might shift to the woman. She had swatted away a lunging thrust, shifted to the side quickly then thrust with a mishappen branch she had picked up. The man staggered back from the force of the blow and the women stepped into the advantage, trying to bring her weight to bear on him. She easily outweighhed him and crashing down on him with her might would have knocked him off her feet.

Then this man named Cotton saw Manan crouched in the snow and an violent, hard, determined look set on his face. He gained his footing underneath him and brought his sword around in a wide swinging arc. The woman went to block, but the blow cleaved the branch in two. She threw both ends at the man, who swatted them away, and she retreated, grabbing Manan as she went.

They weren't heading back to the cave. She's trying to lead him away from the girl, Manan realized. The man was slow, but they weren't much faster, together at least. Manan's feet kept slipping out from under her. She looked back and saw the man slipping too, but there he was nevertheless.

Suddenly the woman stopped and grabbed a heavy stone, hurling it at the man. Snow scattered widlly in the air. It must have come quickly at him, because he didn't dodge it. The stone struck his leg, leaving him curled over in the pain. This gave them a chance to gain the advantage. "He'll keep coming at us," the woman said, when the finally gained higher ground overlooking the area they had just covered. "He's sworn to. He won't return until he has the girl."

"Or he is dead," Manan added. The woman nodded in agreement.

They watched the man race back and forth beneath them, looking for a strong trail. The snow fell quickly and did an adequate job covering their tracks. Not well enough though. He seemed to light on their general direction and began following the broken trail of footsteps to where they stood.

Their backs pressed to the rock now, the woman whispered, "Do you have your knife?" Manan felt at her side. It wasn't there. She shook her head. The woman seemed disappointed, even dismayed by the fact, which surprised her. 

"We need weapons," Manan said.

"Not necessarily. You draw his attention and lead him to that tree. I'll deal with him from there. But when I do, keep running and get to the girl. This place is no longer safe for us. We must leave."

Manan was reluctant to leave the hard press of the stone, and it felt like leaping into dead space when she finally stood and began scrambling down to intercept the man. He caught sight of her and shouted, "You cannot escape me." Manan began running, only able to trust the woman. She saw the tree and saw the woman hiding behind the tree. To Manan she seemed to stand out and be obvious, but surely this man Cotton was so filled with rage that he didn't see her.

As they passed the tree, the woman sprang out from behind the tree and gripped the man in her powerful arms. She locked his head tight and began to squeeze, lifting the man up from the group. He legs swung widly back and forth and he clawed at the woman's arms. His strength was nothing compared to hers though.

"Run, girl, run!" the woman shouted. But Manan was frozen in place. She couldn't help but watch; she wanted to watch as this man's life slipped from his body and this world.

But something unexpected happened, then man must have had some kind of dagger or razer hidden in the metal sleeves that protected his arms. He stabbed wildly at the woman. She held her grip at first, but then the pain was too much. She dropped the man, reeling back, cut up and drenched in blood. 

The dagger must have been poisoned too. As the man caught his breath, the woman began to foam at the mouth and seize. She fell to the ground with a thud. The man swaggered to her and brought his sword down handily at her neck. 

Manan began hurling snow at the man as he approached her, "Get away! Get away from me!" she shouted. But he kept coming, holding his sword loosely in his hand, this grappling it tight again, only to loosen. The sword bobbed up and down as if brought to life now by the woman's blood. Manan tried to run, but she tripped over feet in retreat.

The man loomed over her only he didn't draw the sword and strike her. He grabbed her roughly and brought her to his feet. With the woman dead now, he seemed more powerful than he had in her presence. But his force and power was quick and jagged, not mountainous and heavy like the woman. He brought her inches from his face. His teeth were strangely white and clean. "Take me to the girl, then I kill you," he said, throwing her back to the ground.

She wanted to cry out that she would never lead him to her, but collected her wits. "I can't. She's dead. She died two days ago. We buried along the road. You were too blind to see it. She even left a marker."

The man stepped to her, but Manan stepped back. "You're lying girl."

"No I'm not. She's dead and she's better off being dead."

"If only it were that simple. Now take me there."

Manan could see the dead thing that had been the woman. She wanted to strike out at this man somehow, but how? She could only think to perpetuate the lie. "I can't she's dead."

"Let's not start all over. I know that she is not dead."

"How can you know that?"

"I know because I am her sworn guardian. I am bound to her. I know because her blood flows in mine." Manan looked shocked. "Yes, I was made to drink her blood and do it reguarly. I have felt the fire that girl possesses inside me."

"Then why don't you go and get her."

"Because the blood has grown thin. The connection is thin. And now you will lead me to her."

Was it really futile to resist this guardian, this avenging spirit? Manan had no weapons. Her potions and tricks were stowed away in her travelling clothes in the cave. She could only throw snow at this man so long before he simply cut her down. Besides, she thought, the man will find the girl eventually. 

Then a small voice in her mind simply said, "Maybe the girl should go back." She wasn't fit for the world, after all. She was merely a child, a child in a young woman's body. She would never have enough sense to live without Manan. And what would their life be like anyway. Running from this gruesome guardian who ingested the girl's blood to protect her. Manan would never have done that. So, maybe she should simply lead him to the cave and all of this confusion would be over.

The revolting voice was halted by terrible screams of pain. Manan looked dumbly at her own body. She expected to see a sword stickign out of her side, or an arm on the ground. But she wasn't wounded, not in the least. It was the man who was screaming. No, shrieking now, crying for mercy, "I'm your protector! How can you do this!"

There was the girl, wrapped around the man, undressed in the snow. Her entire body glowed a hideous translucent red. Manan thought that she could see right through her. The girl pressed herself against the man and he was burning up in his skin as she did.

The girl was trapped when the smoking pile of ruins fell to the ground. The snow smoked and the ground beneath began to singe, but the girl held tight. Manan scrambled to her feet. She tore off her clock. It wouldn't offer much protection from the girl, but enough for now. She heaped now over the dead thing, and pushed it off of the girl.

"It's okay, it's okay. He's gone now." The girl rolled side to side. Manan dropped the cloak over her. The loose fibers of the rough spun thing began to burn too, as they were not protected like the girl's regular coverings. But Manan was able to pick her up, hold her by the shoulders, and lead her back to the cave.

##Chapter 5##

When they returned to the cave, they found the beast rearing and snorting and stamping at the ground. It turned to them and seemed likely to charge. It knows that she's dead, Manan thought. She felt pity for the poor beast, who really seemed to be so much more than a simple beast.

"Wait here," she said to the girl. It was strange to see the girl shivering where she stood, even though the snow melted when it touched her. The cloak wouldn't hold up for much longer, but Manan had to calm the beast down. As she approached it, she tried to keep down the panic. Where would they go? Who could they turn to for protection. Maybe she had been weak to trust and rely on the woman, but the woman had been there. So Manan chose to rely on and trust her. But now the woman was gone, split in two and no longer able to protect these two girls from the world. 

Manan tried to creep towards the beast, but the beast shook its head violently and stamped. But it still didn't charge. Manan pulled back her shoulders and rolled her neck from side to side. She had seen horse wranglers and animal trainers try to settle violent animals before. The wranglers always seemed so calm, so possessed of themselves. She tried to let the stress fall from her body and approach the beast in a peaceful way.

Maybe if she could convince it that everything was okay, then everything woudl be okay. Maybe if the beast accepted this new reality, then Manan could too. She was steps away before the beast finally did lunge at her and knock her off her feet.

Behind her, Manan heard the girl humming the broken pieces of a tune. None of the sounds made any real sense alone, but together they seemed oddly harmonious. Certainly the beast thought so. It began to circle around then stood in place. Manan got up slowly, "Keep singing," she whispered. The girl nodded and closed her eyes to keep carrying the tune.

This time the beast let Manan put a hand on her. She began rubbing the pelt back and forth, up and down its strained neck. She had done this many times over the last few days, but now she was crying and hugging the beast. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry," she kept repeating, though she couldn't have said who she was apologizing to.

The girl was standing near her now. "It will be okay. He's a good beast." She smiled and the beast looked at the girl. "Come on beast, we have to leave now."

The beast turned and entered the cave. The girls followed it. It was time to break up their little domestic scene, however rough it might have been. Manan retrieved the rest of the weapons from the store and flung them in the back of the wagon. Then she gathered up the girl's coverings and carefully wrapped her back up.

"I was trying to take a bath," the girl said, pointing at the wooden tub that was filled with cold water. "But something didn't seem right." And it hadn't been right, Manan thought. None of this was right, but their actions--her actions--had led them here. The beast stood patiently in front of the wagon. It had already accepted this new reality. Could she be as brave as the beast, Manan wondered.

With everything packed, the girls went to hitching the beast up to the wagon. The woman had been able to lift the wagon and harness the beast with ease. These two girls struggled and fought until finally the rig was set up.

There was only one thing to do now. Manan turned to the girl. "I'm sorry, but you'll have to go back in the wagon."

"In the compartment? In the dark?" Manan nodded.

The beast snorted, as if to urge them along. No negotiating, the girl had to go in. "It's too dangerous. We'll draw enough attention as it is. We can't be seen riding together..." But this appeal didn't move the girl who studied the back of the wagon.

"I don't want to go in the dark. I hate the dark" she said.

"I know. I know. I wish we could do it another way. There's no other option..." What could she say, Manan wondered. She couldn't clobber the girl or compel her to go. The beast snorted. Manan tried again. "They will not stop coming for us. We have to go and we have to go now. Maybe things will change when we're far away. I don't know."

The girl suddenly seemed much older than before, looking at Manan she stood up straight. "You're very brave, Manan. You're trying to protect me. I'll get in the wagon."

Together they set aside the covering and the floor boards in the wagon. The girl pressed herself into the small dark space. Manan wondered how they both had travelled in there. But she remembered that the woman had been there to compell them, one way or another. She put everything back into place then jumped up on to the front of the wagon. Much as she had before, she only fingered the reins loosely. The beast spun them around and headed out of the cave and into the increasingly savage cold wind and swirling snow.
