#The Poisoned Well#

##Chapter One##

The arrows, hurtled from the dark recesses of the trees, fell around them, skidding stupidly along the ice. Manan, running at full tilt, felt giddy and powerful and terrified all at the same time. The other girl, whose hand she gripped tightly, seemed less bouyed by the hail of flint, wood, and arrows. Manan gave her a rough tug just before an arrow landed right at their heels. It bounced, tipped, and verred away. We may just make it, she thought, seeing the ice lake's shore just ahead.

Whoever let the next arrow fly, however, had a truer aim. The arrow didn't find it's mark, but it grazed the other girl's calf, shredding the folds of rough spun blankets, leaving a trail of blood behind. Fortunately for Manan, the girl was so insensible that the wound didn't seem to phase her. The girl just groaned and continued being pulled along the ice.

Manon tried not to look back, tried to keep her eyes trained on the shore line that grew nearer and nearer. She could start to see shapes of the trees emerge from the dark rough mass that stood there previously. With her senses fired up the way they though, everything stood out sharply, including the streaks of fire in the dark sky. The dry, brittly brush along the lake caught fire and began to light up the night. 

The flaming arrows became more constant now but there was more lake to cross. Manon decided to peer back over her shoulder, just to be sure no one was on their trail. The ice was thick, she knew, but a whole pack of men pounding over it probably would break it, at least that was her hope. As she turned her head, though, her foot caught in the girl's loose, tattered coverings and they spilled forward, sliding several feet across the ice.

They spun out and around, facing each other on their stomachs. Their eyes met then became obscured by the puffs of their breath in the cold. "Are you okay?" Manan asked the girl.

"I...I think so..." the girl replied, shivering out the words. 

Crouching on that flat sheet of ice wouldn't save them, but they rested until they heard dogs barking and whimpering. The whimpering gave way to the sound of paws and nails fervently scratching at the ice to reach them. It was time to move again, but both girls seemed frozen in place.

As they lay there, though, Manan could see steam rising up from around the girl. She's melting the ice around her, she realized. The ice probably wouldn't crack, but it wouldn't hold forever. Manan didn't intend to slip through a hole in the ice, and she certainly didn't care to be mauled by dogs.

She sat the girl up, careful not to touch her exposed hands and arms. The dogs were gaining on them, maybe would overtake them no matter what. Fortunatley, the air increasingly was tinged with the smell of burning brush and pitch. Though she hated to waste supplies, the sizzling, melting ice and the girl who melted it gave her an idea. She reached for a bottle filled with dark powder from her coat and put in in the girls hands, "Hold this for for me," she told the girl.

She dropped the bottle carefully. Instantly, the bottle began to lose its shape, Manan yanked it back and tossed it across the ice, towards the dogs. The bottle crashed and popped loudly on the ice. A bright wall of flames reach up and arked forward. Behind the glare and glow, Manon could only hear the dogs wimpering and retreating.

The pyrotechnics seemed to stanch the flood of arrows too. Without the constant twang and scrape around them, the night suddenly seemed very quiet. Manan picked up the girl and heaved her forward. Soon enough their huffing breath kept the quiet at bay.

Running on ice wasn't easy, but crashing through the dead undergrowth of the forest with a limp loose girl wasn't any better. The girl kept stumbling and falling. When she tried to pick herself up, the branches would singe and the rocks go black. This won't do, Manan though, realzing that they were leaving an obvious trail behind them. 

They had lost the element of surprise entirely, though, so darting off into the night wasn't really much of an option anyway. Manan had underestimated how much sleeping powder it would take to make the large potbellied man who watched over the girl at night stay asleep. The cruel thing wasn't that he awoke, rather that his half-asleep tossings and moanings woke the boy who was his attendant, a word which the villagers used in place of the word "slave."

The boy, who normally had tried to keep as much covering to himself as possible, woke quickly when all of the furs and blankets were yanked from him. He must have been cold blooded like a reptile, Manan though, given how tolerant of the heat he was. As her own face dripped in sweat, the boy took to shivering then shouting when he saw her lifting the girl from her resting place.

Quick as she was with her throwing knives, the only weapon she had learned to use with any confidence, she couldn't plunge one in the boy's stomach fast enough to keep him from waking up he village. She managed to esapce with the girl, but only before rousing every hunter in the village armed with a long bow and a bountiful quiver of arrows.

Even had she and the girl been able to slip through the forest unheard and unseen, they probably could not evade the villager's will to find them forever. That will exposed to Manan the fundatemtnal flaw in her plan. It was too late now to undecide her course of action. She had chosen to steal away this girl, this girl who burned everything the touched, and kept the village by the icy lake warm during its endless winters.

Their crashing and scurrying came to sudden halt at a sword's point. "Did you think you could steal away our precious child?" the man known as Cotton asked her. He was an old man, something like a village elder, but really an outsider employed by the village to protect the girl who became to slump into Manan's arms. "Did you think that I, her protector, would let a little trickster magician like you run out and get away? Foolish child."

During her short time in the village, Manan had not interacted much with the man called Cotton. Had this been the vain village council man, or a silly girl dazzled by her magic show, then a slight of hand or some clever words might have sufficed to lower the blade. But this man before them seemed implacable. 

"By my oath, I should kill you now for violating the sacred rights of ownership that the good people of that village assert over this child."

"But she isn't even their natural born child, you know that!"

"She became so when the village took her in and cared for her..."

"And imprisoned her and exploited her..."

"As opposed to, what, child? This girl, your captive, my ward, is a freak of nature, a cast off and rejected. You cannot amend what Nature has set forth. And now, I must make right what you have determined to make wrong."

The girl began to whimper and shake in distress as the man named Cotton drew back his sword. Yet instead of hearing the woosh of his sword, Manan only heard an oompf and thud as he hit the ground. Looking up, an enormous woman filled the space where he had once been. She carried a cudgel made from a knotted branch and was wrapped head to foot in furs.

"He always was to talkative for my taste," the woman said. "Didn't even hear me coming, did you, old boy?" She grinned and laughed. "Come on girl, get the other one up, we've got to get back to the road."

Without comment, Manan picked up the girl and tried to work through the rest of the woods as best as they could. Fortunately, this large giant of a woman had beaten back the forest in her wake. 

When they stepped out of the woods onto the narrow road, Manan saw the woman's cart and shaggy oxen harnassed to it. "Get it and we'll be away from here soon enough. Be careful with the girl. I don't need by livlihood going up in flames," she said.
