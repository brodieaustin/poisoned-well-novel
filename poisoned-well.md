#The Poisoned Well#

##Chapter One##

The arrows, hurtled from the dark recesses of the trees, fell around them, skidding stupidly along the ice. Manan, running at full tilt, felt giddy and powerful and terrified all at the same time. The other girl, whose hand she gripped tightly, seemed less buoyed by the hail of flint, wood, and arrows. Manan gave her a rough tug just before an arrow landed right at their heels. It bounced, tipped, and veered away. We may just make it, she thought, seeing the ice lake's shore just ahead.

Whoever let the next arrow fly, however, had a truer aim. The arrow didn't find it's mark, but it grazed the other girl's calf, shredding the folds of rough spun blankets, leaving a trail of blood behind. Fortunately for Manan, the girl was so insensible that the wound didn't seem to phase her. The girl just groaned and continued being pulled along the ice.

Manon tried not to look back, tried to keep her eyes trained on the shore line that grew nearer and nearer. She could start to see shapes of the trees emerge from the dark rough mass that stood there previously. With her senses fired up the way they though, everything stood out sharply, including the streaks of fire in the dark sky. The dry, brittle brush along the lake caught fire and began to light up the night. 

The flaming arrows became more constant now but there was more lake to cross. Manon decided to peer back over her shoulder, just to be sure no one was on their trail. The ice was thick, she knew, but a whole pack of men pounding over it probably would break it, at least that was her hope. As she turned her head, though, her foot caught in the girl's loose, tattered coverings and they spilled forward, sliding several feet across the ice.

They spun out and around, facing each other on their stomachs. Their eyes met then became obscured by the puffs of their breath in the cold. "Are you okay?" Manan asked the girl.

"I...I think so..." the girl replied, shivering out the words. 

Crouching on that flat sheet of ice wouldn't save them, but they rested until they heard dogs barking and whimpering. The whimpering gave way to the sound of paws and nails fervently scratching at the ice to reach them. It was time to move again, but both girls seemed frozen in place.

As they lay there, though, Manan could see steam rising up from around the girl. She's melting the ice around her, she realized. The ice probably wouldn't crack, but it wouldn't hold forever. Manan didn't intend to slip through a hole in the ice, and she certainly didn't care to be mauled by dogs.

She sat the girl up, careful not to touch her exposed hands and arms. The dogs were gaining on them, maybe would overtake them no matter what. Fortunately, the air increasingly was tinged with the smell of burning brush and pitch. Though she hated to waste supplies, the sizzling, melting ice and the girl who melted it gave her an idea. She reached for a bottle filled with dark powder from her coat and put in in the girls hands, "Hold this for for me," she told the girl.

She dropped the bottle carefully. Instantly, the bottle began to lose its shape, Manan yanked it back and tossed it across the ice, towards the dogs. The bottle crashed and popped loudly on the ice. A bright wall of flames reach up and arced forward. Behind the glare and glow, Manon could only hear the dogs whimpering and retreating.

The pyrotechnics seemed to stanch the flood of arrows too. Without the constant twang and scrape around them, the night suddenly seemed very quiet. Manan picked up the girl and heaved her forward. Soon enough their huffing breath kept the quiet at bay.

***

Running on ice wasn't easy, but crashing through the dead undergrowth of the forest with a limp loose girl wasn't any better. The girl kept stumbling and falling. When she tried to pick herself up, the branches would singe and the rocks go black. This won't do, Manan though, realizing that they were leaving an obvious trail behind them. 

They had lost the element of surprise entirely, though, so darting off into the night wasn't really much of an option anyway. Manan had underestimated how much sleeping powder it would take to make the large potbellied man who watched over the girl at night stay asleep. The cruel thing wasn't that he awoke, rather that his half-asleep tossings and moanings woke the boy who was his attendant, a word which the villagers used in place of the word "slave."

The boy, who normally had tried to keep as much covering to himself as possible, woke quickly when all of the furs and blankets were yanked from him. He must have been cold blooded like a reptile, Manan though, given how tolerant of the heat he was. As her own face dripped in sweat, the boy took to shivering then shouting when he saw her lifting the girl from her resting place.

Quick as she was with her throwing knives, the only weapon she had learned to use with any confidence, she couldn't plunge one in the boy's stomach fast enough to keep him from waking up he village. She managed to escape with the girl, but only before rousing every hunter in the village armed with a long bow and a bountiful quiver of arrows.

Even had she and the girl been able to slip through the forest unheard and unseen, they probably could not evade the villager's will to find them forever. That will exposed to Manan the fundamental flaw in her plan. It was too late now to undecided her course of action. She had chosen to steal away this girl, this girl who burned everything the touched, and kept the village by the icy lake warm during its endless winters.

Their crashing and scurrying came to sudden halt at a sword's point. "Did you think you could steal away our precious child?" the man known as Cotton asked her. He was an old man, something like a village elder, but really an outsider employed by the village to protect the girl who became to slump into Manan's arms. "Did you think that I, her protector, would let a little trickster magician like you run out and get away? Foolish child."

During her short time in the village, Manan had not interacted much with the man called Cotton. Had this been the vain village council man, or a silly girl dazzled by her magic show, then a slight of hand or some clever words might have sufficed to lower the blade. But this man before them seemed implacable. 

"By my oath, I should kill you now for violating the sacred rights of ownership that the good people of that village assert over this child."

"But she isn't even their natural born child, you know that!"

"She became so when the village took her in and cared for her..."

"And imprisoned her and exploited her..."

"As opposed to, what, child? This girl, your captive, my ward, is a freak of nature, a cast off and rejected. You cannot amend what Nature has set forth. And now, I must make right what you have determined to make wrong."

The girl began to whimper and shake in distress as the man named Cotton drew back his sword. Yet instead of hearing the whoosh of his sword, Manan only heard an oompf and thud as he hit the ground. Looking up, an enormous woman filled the space where he had once been. She carried a cudgel made from a knotted branch and was wrapped head to foot in furs.

"He always was to talkative for my taste," the woman said. "Didn't even hear me coming, did you, old boy?" She grinned and laughed. "Come on girl, get the other one up, we've got to get back to the road."

Without comment, Manan picked up the girl and tried to work through the rest of the woods as best as they could. Fortunately, this large giant of a woman had beaten back the forest in her wake. 

When they stepped out of the woods onto the narrow road, Manan saw the woman's cart and shaggy oxen harnassed to it. "Get it and we'll be away from here soon enough. Be careful with the girl. I don't need by livelihood going up in flames," she said.

***

The shaggy beast pulling the cart wasn't a horse and couldn't be whipped up to a brisk trot. All that Manan could do was fret in the back hidden under loose planks on the floor. With a heavy cloth thrown over everything, the space was cramped and hot. It didn't help being so close to the girl, either. 

The woman had helped Manan wrap the girl back up carefully before easing her into the shallow channel. The woman had shrugged at the cut on the girl's leg. The blood was already drying and crusting in place. "At least she's no bleeder," the woman said. They shoved her him, then Manan wiggled in next to her, hoping that the cart wouldn't go up in flames.

Though she was young, she had had a brief career already in the various dark arts of sneaking, smuggling, and trickery. She had spent several months with a group of smugglers who were equipped with carts very similar to this one. Would others recognize the creaking, deep bottomed wagon for what it was? Or would they pass over as this...merchant made her way down from the mountains.

Knowing that she couldn't burst forth from her captivity and take the reins, Manan spent her confinement collecting her thoughts. She focused particularly on this women and tried to separate out all of the pieces that might explain why she was helping them. And how had she found them in the woods. Of course, another thing Manan had learned in her brief career was to no prod too far into the circumstances surrounding good fortune. Making luck could be a very dirty business sometimes.

She had seen the woman a few times in the village in the days leading up to this...caper. "The Water Woman," the villagers called her, and probably many more like them. Of course, Manan knew that she was one of just many water women, and a smattering of men too. But this one was unique for her size and strength, no doubt gained by hauling and lugging huge containers of water here and there.

Even under the planks and canvas covering, she could here the water sloshing back and forth in their heavy pots. As they traveled on, the water made Manan feel as though they were stow aways on a ship crossing rough seas. At least there in the open water your destination was shore. Here on land, shoved in this woman's wagon, the destination was unknown, Manan's course uncharted.

##Chapter Two##

"The sun?" was the first questioned she asked in the glare of daylight. The light had leapt into the channel at the bottom of wagon suddenly, aggressively when the woman pulled back the covering and fake boards. 

"Yes, it's daytime now. Has been for a while," the woman replied. She reached down to help Manan up and out. "You can stretch your legs if you'd like, but make it quick." As Manan looked back at the girl, the woman added, "Don't worry about her, she's got a few more hours of sleep stored up in her."

It was true, the poor girl probably hadn't slept, really slept in months, if not years. Not that Manan, with her usuall hand to mouth existence, could claim much better, but begin haggard and grumpy could not compare to what this girl had gone through. Or, so she supposed.

She jumped down from the wagon and her stiff legs caught her and boyoued her up. They loosened quickly enough as she paced aroudn the wagon. Now in the daylight, she could feel the cold mountain air seeping through her clothes. Last night had been excitement and momentum. No time for cold when you were capering. 

"Dont' wander off," the woman warned her. "And be careful about your tracks." 

The road here, really the ruts that made up the road now, was really just layers and layers of compacted snow. If it hadn't been for the surefooted oxedn and the studded wagon wheels, they would not have made it far at all. Manan's feet even slipped out from under her several times. She caught her balance quicky, As I always do, she though, but the inner bravado was all acting, really. On the compacted road, her route around the wagon would leeave little to no trail, certainly nothing that the village hunters could pick up. They were skilled at tracking antlered beasts, but not tracking men for leagues and leagues.

As she paced, Manan struggled to reorganized the thoughts she had managed to line up and make tidy the night before. With her legs stuff and belly tinged with hunger, it was harder to keep those ordered facts in place. They had a tendency to wander and reshuffle just as she wanted to turn over some bit in her mind.

One particular bit was the woman's name. She though that she had heard someone address the Water Woman in the village, but the name would not surface in her mind. Strangely, given that she was human contraband on this woman's wagon, Manan felt relucatant to ask. Playing the game truly and well meant arming yourself with information before asserting some position. Not know much about this woman made Manan feel weak, and she hated feeling weak.

Wrapped up as tight in these inner convolutions as she was in her rough spun cloak and coverings, she didn't hear to woman calling her over to sit. When she did hear, she came over to the back of the wagon. The woman sat there with a handful of something. She offered them to Manan and said, "Chew these for your hunger. I don't have much else right now."

The wrinkled hard seeds became tacky and chewy as Manan tried to eat them. Deciding that she couldn't chew them, she settled on sucking on a handful of them in the back of her check. Whatever they were, she felt revitalized very quickly, ready to continue their...journey.

***

[update](#update)As the wagon rocked and bounced over those hard ice roads, Manan swayed in and out of sleep. Several hours after the break, the wagon lurched to a stop. Manan's eyes opened wide at the sound of a man's voices. The girl was still asleep. Hopefully she would stay that way. Reflexively she felt her hand drift ot he knife at her waist. It would be useless to fight if they discovered her, but her instincts were tuned this way. So, she didn't resist them and palmed the worn wooden hilt. 

She could only just make out what was happening outside, but she heard the woman assert, "You've no claim to search me..." Then an argument ensued. The wagon rocked back and forth. The quarrel was agitating the beast. The woman tried to calm it. Manan twisted slighly to press her ear closer to the wagon's bottom to hear better.

"My people passed untouched. That's a right we have."

"Rights ent meant for smugglers," said a man's voice. If there was only one voice and one man, Manan assumed that the woman would dispatch him as easily as she had Cotton.

But there was another voice, "Words gotten around. The villages have been put on alert...two girls and maybe a Water Woman accomplice. And we look after our own..."

By rights they weren't able to search her wagon, Manan knew. The Water Women could not be seized, jailed, or otherwise molested. It had always been that way. But that didn't stop a heavy pair of boots from stomping overhead in the wagon. A man, smelling of smoke and ale, began rifling through the wagon. With the coverings over the floor, Manan couldn't see where he was, but could hear each creak on the floor boards and feel them press closer to her face under the man's weight.

The man shouted out, "Nothing in her but the dame's old pots..." His voice was loud and harsh after all of the muffled rattling and shuffling. The sound woke the girl up, her eyes perfectly round and bright all of a sudden. She was bound very tightly in her covering but tried to thrash regardless. Before she could cry out, Manan gripped her mouth tightly.

The bright big eyes just stared back at her stupidly, only animated by animal fear. Manan could hear the man muttering, "Queer cart...what's that sound...awful hot in here..." Then a pot shattered on the ground. And another. Another one again.

The wagon bounced. The woman had jumped down. The men raised their cries. Manan could hear a bow being drawn and quarterstaffs knocking violently against each other. A man cried out in pain. Another one cursed the woman's sex and invoked the gods too. Manan heard the bow release and thud into something, a tree? A woman? She couldn't tell.

But a crackle of bone and a squish of flesh followed the thud. Another pot crashed loudly to the ground before the cart was rid of the intruder and his boots. A loud oopmh then a plea for mercy. "You defiled me and my trade. You broke the ancient pacts. By law I can and will kill you." the woman said. And then the intruder and his boots died a loud but quick death.

With that, Manan was staring up at the woman's face. She had a large red welt on the side of her face. It wasn't until Manan sat up that she saw an arrow poking out from the woman's side and blood flowing freely over her clothing, coloring the wagon's covering red. "You're hurt," she said.

"Yes, but I will survive. You'll help me. I need you to drive the cart."

"But where are we going."

"Some place safe and not far, but I will be too weak to drive soon. The beast knows the way. I have whispered it to him, but we can't have a riderless wagon along these roads, especially at night and especially where we're going. Go up front a drive. Now."

Manan usually didn't take commands well, but she listened to the woman's strained order. She jumped out of the wagon and ran to front. Around her, six men lay dead; seven counting the one who had searched the wagon. Good riddance, she thought, though not exactly sure why. Had these been bad men? Perhaps, but they had crossed lines that weren't meant to be crossed. Lines that were recognized and acknowledged and held firmly in place. 

Whether she too had crossed such lines didn't occur to her as she took up the stiff reins. The beast lurched forth now that it senesed a driver in place. Manan didn't know how to drive an animal, but the woman was right. The beast seemed to know where it was going.
